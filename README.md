# ROM Toolkit
This is a web app for manipulating ROM files. It is written
in Typescript using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Material UI](https://mui.com/).

It currently supports header modification for:
- Game Boy / Gameboy Color
- Gameboy Advance
- Nintendo Entertainment System
- Super Nintendo Entertainment System

It also supports patching with these formats:
- IPS
- UPS

(You can patch any file type, not just ROM types mentioned above)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
