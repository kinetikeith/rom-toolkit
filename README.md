# ROM Toolkit
This is a web app for manipulating ROM files. It is written
in Typescript using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Material UI](https://mui.com/). It currently supports header editing for Gameboy
and SNES as well as IPS patching of any file type.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
