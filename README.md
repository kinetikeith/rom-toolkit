# ROM Toolkit
This is a web app for manipulating ROM files. It is written
in Typescript using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Material UI](https://mui.com/).
It is inspired by
[Rom Patcher JS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) (by Marc Robledo).

It currently supports header modification for:
- Game Boy / Gameboy Color
- Game Boy Advance
- Nintendo Entertainment System
- Super Nintendo Entertainment System

These ROMs (and actually any other type of file) may be patched using the
following formats:
- IPS
- UPS
- BPS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
